#Task 1
Construct a random 3x28x28 NumPy array called original to represent an image and then convert this into into a 1x(3x28x28) array called flat. This converts it into a single row of pixels. Next, convert this to a 1D array (flatten the array using flat.flatten()). Print shape of all arrays. You may use the random function to generate the array.

Print out the following:

*  shape of the arrays.
*  data types of the arrays.

A 3x28x28 basically means 28x28 matrices repeated three times. How would you access the first 10 elements of the 2nd row of the second 28x28 matrix? Consider the original array for this. Print the elements.

A 3x28x28 image means 3 channels of Red, Green, or Blue (Popularly known as RGB image). Each color channel has a height and width, which is 28X28 in this case. The entire picture can represented through this method. Print the shape of the Blue pixel matrix and its first 3 rows.

Can we create a 3x3 array of the first 50 even numbers? Why or why not? What are other values of m and n for which mxn dimension is allowed for 50 elements?

We can't create a 3x3 array of the first 50 even number as this array consists of 50 element which cannot be fitted into odd number shape array. Some values of m and n allowed would be:



*   m=2 , n=25 or vice verse
*   m=5, n=10 or vice verse
*   m=1, n=50 or vice verse
