## TensorBoard (Visualization Toolkit)
Some features that TensorBoard provides: 
  - Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
  - Visualizing the model graph
  - Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
  - Displaying images, text, and audio data
    
## Train, Test and Validation Set
- `Train Set` : The sample of data used to fit (train) the model.
- `Test Dataset` : The sample of data used for the final evaluation of model’s performance.
- `Validation Dataset` : A portion of Train Set. The sample of data used to provide an evaluation of model’s performance while tuning model hyperparameters.

## Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting : Model performs well on training data but performs poorly on data not seen during training. Model has memorized the training data instead of learning the relationships between features and labels.
- Underfitting : Model cannot capture the underlying trend of the data. Model neither getting a good accuracy in training data, nor in test/validation data.


## Bias and Variance
- Bias :  Represents how unfair is something towards others
- Variance : Represents how likely something changes with respect to others
